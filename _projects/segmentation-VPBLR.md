excerpt: 'This paper shows how to scale up training sets for semantic segmentation by using video prediction-based data synthesis method. Our proposed joint propagation strategy and boundary relaxation technique can alleviate the lable noise in the synthesized samples and lead to state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets Cityscapes, CamVid and KITTI.'

In this paper, we propose an effective video prediction-based data synthesis method to scale up training sets for semantic segmentation. We also introduce a joint propagation strategy to alleviate mis-alignments in synthesized samples. Furthermore, we present a novel boundary relaxation technique to mitigate label noise. The label relaxation strategy can also be used for human annotated labels and not just synthesized labels. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets Cityscapes, CamVid and KITTI.


Code for training and inference, along with our pretrained models, is available on our [Github repository][segmentation-VPBLR].
